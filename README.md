This mini project is about writing a dynamic allocation memory management library.
So that you can use it with some programs already in use without modifying them or recompiling, you must rewrite the following libc functions malloc(3), free(3) and realloc(3).

## Compile

	$> make

## Run

	$> cd test
	$> ./run.sh <program>
